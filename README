RTLSDR Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================
Implement rtlsdr ability for opencpn to receive ais messages

Configuration using rtl_fm and aisdecoder
=================================================

First, you must be able to run rtl_fm and aisdecoder applications to recieve ais data.
This is independent from the plugin itself, the plugin merely runs these programs
piping the data from rtl_fm to aisdecoder and then into opencpn.  The plugin
can also perform automatic calibration.

For windows, I have compiled the needed programs using mingw, and
provided binaries already (in the buildwin/bin directory)

Otherwise you must compile from source and install:

git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
cd rtl-sdr
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

wget http://www.aishub.net/downloads/aisdecoder.tar.gz
tar zxvf aisdecoder
cd aisdecoder
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
make
sudo cp aisdecoder /usr/local/bin

Test with:
rtl_fm -f 161975000 -p 35 -s 48k | aisdecoder -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10110 -a file -c mono -d -f /dev/stdin

be sure to try all possible values for -p!  this program is very picky and your value must be +- 7
of the correct value to get messages (Range +- 128)  the exact correct value gives many more messages.
The plugin provides an automatic detection routine.

At this point you can simply add a udp data connection on port 10110 and not use the plugin, but the
plugin automatically invokes the programs, and provides other control.

Configuration using gnuradio
=================================================

The plugin also can run gnuradio to decode ais data, but I do not provide
binaries to do this under windows.

apt-get install libboost-all-dev uhd swig
apt-get install gnuradio gnuradio-dev
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/gr-osmosdr
cd gr-osmosdr
if gnuradio 3.6 is installed "git checkout gr3.6"
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j2
sudo make install

sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev libfftw3-dev python-numpy
git clone https://github.com/bistromath/gr-ais.git
cd gr-ais
for gnuradio 3.6 "git checkout 1381ceca81b0cf238eeb81da9cd77189da74022a"
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

Compiling
=========
* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone git://github.com/seandepagnier/rtlsdr_pi.git

Build as normally:

* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install
